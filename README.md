During this bootcamp, I developed advanced skills in **Python programming**, **data manipulation with Pandas**, and **data visualisation** using libraries like **Seaborn** and **Bokeh**. I 
participated in hands-on projects, including a hackathon where I analysed streaming service data to generate actionable insights. Additionally, I refined my ability to create and present 
**data-driven narratives**, equipping me to tackle complex data challenges and communicate insights effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills
- **Programming**: Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualisation**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh

- **Techniques**: Data Cleaning, EDA, Storytelling with Data, Visualisation

## üíº About Me
I am a **Data Analyst** with a **First-Class Honour degree in Economics** and experience in both **Professional Services** and the **Public Sector**. I excel in data analysis, visualisation, and delivering actionable insights using tools like **Python**, **Pandas**, and **SQL Server**. I thrive in both team-based projects and individual work environments, and I am seeking roles focused on **Data Analysis**.

## üìÇ Projects
**Comparative Analysis of Customer Profiles Across Treadmill Models**: In this group project, customer profiles were compared across treadmill models TM195, TM498, and TM798 to
identify trends and differences in user demographics and usage patterns. By analysing customer data, insights were uncovered that can inform marketing strategies and product
development. The findings are intended to help optimise product offerings and better understand the typical customer for each model. The project includes data analysis, visualisations, and a presentation summarising our key conclusions and recommendations.

**Optimising Streaming Services: Insights from Netflix Data**: In this group project, a Netflix dataset was analysed to provide strategic recommendations for CS-Streaming's new service.
The data was cleaned and preprocessed, exploratory and statistical analyses was conducted, and clustering techniques were used to uncover trends and user behaviour. The analysis aims to
offer actionable insights for optimising the new streaming service and competing with Netflix. The deliverables include a comprehensive notebook, visualisations, and a presentation
highlighting key findings and recommendations.
