## üìÇ Projects
**Comparative Analysis of Customer Profiles Across Treadmill Models**: In this group project, customer profiles were compared across treadmill models TM195, TM498, and TM798 to
identify trends and differences in user demographics and usage patterns. By analysing customer data, insights were uncovered that can inform marketing strategies and product
development. The findings are intended to help optimise product offerings and better understand the typical customer for each model. The project includes data analysis, visualisations, and a presentation summarising our key conclusions and recommendations.

**Optimising Streaming Services: Insights from Netflix Data**: In this group project, a Netflix dataset was analysed to provide strategic recommendations for CS-Streaming's new service.
The data was cleaned and preprocessed, exploratory and statistical analyses was conducted, and clustering techniques were used to uncover trends and user behaviour. The analysis aims to
offer actionable insights for optimising the new streaming service and competing with Netflix. The deliverables include a comprehensive notebook, visualisations, and a presentation
highlighting key findings and recommendations.
